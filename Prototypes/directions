Prototyping can be documented in one long Word file,
if progress is clear and expectations are fulfilled.

If there are frequent changes to the circumstances or
requirements, it is allowed to use multiple files for
different ideas or to express different stages in development.
Nevertheless, the current branch must always contain information
about the previous attempts.
