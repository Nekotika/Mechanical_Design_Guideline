At this stage, two documents must be completed.

One is the action plan, and the other is the project planning.

The action plan can be a Word document or a presentation with
short explanations of the techniques or equipment that will be used.
It is essential to attach pictures of present tools/equipment,
as well as images and links of things to be ordered.
If there are plenty of options a morphological map can
provide a better layout for keeping track.

The action plan can consist of multiple activities or different
tasks with the same goal. After it is approved and progress
has been made, it must be reflected in a progress report, which
will then serve as a milestone for the next version of the action plan.
Therefore, every new version must reference the old one, even if it is
just to explain how they differ.

Here the costs can be listed and summarized for each particular approach.
ETA is also helpful for decision-making if a planning is not established yet.
