After a mock model or a prototype is made,
it is essential to draft a test plan.

The test plan must be exhaustive and conclusive.
The simplest way to make it is to base it entirely on
the requirements. Depending on their complexity, the entire
file with the requirements can be used, with testing information
added as an explanation or a sequence of steps.
However, for future prototypes, newer versions of the test plan
will be needed and they must be based on the initial test plan,
not on the new requirements. The changes between the prototypes
must then be explained, or linked back to the requirements file.

If more explanations are necessary, the format of the test plan
can be a text document with images or a presentation, but it must
stay consistent for the duration of the project.
