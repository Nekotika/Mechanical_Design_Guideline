For numbering of the requirements use a model like "requirement_1.2.3"
where the first digit is the requirement type, the second and third are
the requirement itself and any other relevant criteria that may be important
to always keep in mind and then a new column should be made for it.

The requirement type is meant to separate the requirements into
groups that can be researched, explored, and tested independently from each other.
This can help when segregating the work between team members and easier planning.
Other classification methods are allowed, so long as they are clear and explained.
