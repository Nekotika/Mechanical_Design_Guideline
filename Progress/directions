The progress report is a key for the project documentation
and can be referred to in the requirements and testing files,
to justify and explain changes in design or approach.

Depending on the project, a progress report may be required
every week, to give a clear summary of the completed work.
If there are a lot of details that all deserve attention,
a progress file can be made in each major folder, tracking
the discoveries and changes to the requirements and testing,
or even just one specific activity.

Technical details must be introduced to the reader with an
image from 3D CAD software, or simply a sketch. Anyone in the
company should be able to understand the premise and thought
process behind the preparations and decisions made.
